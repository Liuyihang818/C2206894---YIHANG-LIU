
!! Because of the different operating systems, the MIL model requires some environment configurations 
which conflict with my Computer Since. And since I have been to a high-risk area of COVID-19 in the
last seven days, I was notified to quarantine on the 6th,  so I cannot reach the computer using the 
Linux system and complete the MIL model training section within the specified time.
